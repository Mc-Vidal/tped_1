            It is the hour for despair. The writer sits, crumpled and waiting. The sun sets. He lays his head upon his
            desk. A plot—he must have a plot. The public, ravenous for story, has no use for his fine observations and
            his subtle characterizations. A plot: his publishers require it, his wife demands it—there is a child now.
            Slowly, miserably, he gouges the words out of himself.

            George Gissing’s 1891 novel, “New Grub Street,” is one of the most pitiless portraits of the writing life in
            any
            age. Set among London’s hacks, grinds, and literary “women of the inkiest description,” the story follows
            Edwin
            Reardon’s nervous and financial collapse as he struggles to complete a book that might sell. His friend, the
            sleek and cynical Jasper Milvain, regards his efforts as so much unnecessary fuss. “Literature nowadays is a
            trade,” Milvain maintains, a matter of deft pandering. Find out what the reader wants and supply it, for
            God’s
            sake, with style and efficiency.

            It’s not just the writer’s usual demons—skimpy word rates, self-doubt, the smooth ascension of one’s
            enemies—that torture Reardon but the strictures of the three-volume frigate that dominated Victorian
            novel-writing. The triple-decker, as it was called, was the form of much work by the likes of Charlotte
            Brontë,
            George Eliot, Benjamin Disraeli, and Anthony Trollope: typically nine hundred octavo pages divided into
            volumes
            of three hundred pages each, handsomely printed and bound. “The three volumes lie before me like an
            interminable
            desert,” Reardon moans. “Impossible to get through them.” Gissing lifted such laments from his own diary;
            “New
            Grub Street” was itself a triple-decker, Gissing’s eighth, and he used every available trick to stretch it,
            wheezily, to length. “The padding trade,” Trollope called literature at the time.

            As luxury items, unaffordable for outright purchase by most readers, triple-deckers were championed by
            Mudie’s
            Select Library, a behemoth of British book distribution. For its founder, Charles Edward Mudie, who often
            bought
            the bulk of a print run and could demand commensurate discounts from publishers, the appeal was plain: since
            his
            subscribers—at least those paying the standard rate of a guinea a year—could borrow only one volume at a
            time,
            each triple-decker could circulate to three times as many subscribers. Publishers were equally fond of the
            form,
            which allowed them to stagger printing costs. A tantalizing first volume could drum up demand for subsequent
            volumes, and help pay for them.

            A great many of the Victorian novel’s distinctive features seem expressly designed to fill up that
            “interminable
            desert” and entice the reader to cross it: a three-act structure, swelling subplots and vast casts, jolting
            cliffhangers, and characters with catchphrases or names that signal their personalities, rendering them
            memorable across nine hundred pages. (Dickens’s naming a bounder Bounderby, in “Hard Times,” is one
            shameless
            example.) Fictional autobiographies and biographies—“Villette,” “Jane Eyre,” “Adam Bede”—worked well with
            the
            demands of the triple-decker; a life story could enfold any necessary digressions and impart to them a sense
            of
            narrative unity.

            The triple-decker prevailed until, toward the end of the nineteenth century, Mudie’s became frustrated with
            a
            glut of books and began requesting single-volume novels from publishers. With the rise of mass-market
            paperbacks
            printed cheaply on pulp paper, new forms were born (pulp fiction, anyone?), with their own dictates, their
            own
            hooks and lures for the reader. But, then, style has always shadowed modes of distribution in the history of
            the
            novel, from magazine serials to the Internet. In “Everything and Less: The Novel in the Age of Amazon”
            (Verso),
            the literary scholar Mark McGurl considers all the ways a new behemoth has transformed not only how we
            obtain
            fiction but how we read and write it—and why. “The rise of Amazon is the most significant novelty in recent
            literary history, representing an attempt to reforge contemporary literary life as an adjunct to online
            retail,”
            he argues.
